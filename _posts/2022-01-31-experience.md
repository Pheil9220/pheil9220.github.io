<h2>Coinflip ATMs, Chicago IL</h2>
Customer Support Representative from May 2020 to November 2021
While at Coinflip I troubleshot, resolved, or escalated technical issues based on customer and associates needs. 
I regularly interviewed clients over the phone and over online chat to obtain case information. 
Following these calls or chats, I documented conversations with customers in order to track requests, problems and solutions. 
During my time at Coinflip I upheld high standards of customer services by responding to inquiries, needs and problems, all while maintaining strict KYC/AML compliance policies. 

<h2>Ruffalo Noel Levitz, Oxford OH</h2>
Student Caller from October 2019 to April 2020
As student callers we took part in scripted sales calls to alumni in order to relay current events going on with the university as well as to solicit donations. 
After these calls we were expected to record, maintain and update customer information in our database.
If an alumni did wish to make a donation, it was our to process it.
