-Ruffalo Noel Levitz, Oxford OH— Student Caller
-October 2019- April 2020
-As student callers we took part in scripted sales calls to alumni in order to relay current events going on with the university as well as to solicit donations. After these calls we were expected to record, maintain and update customer information in our database. If an alumni did wish to make a donation, it was our to process it.
