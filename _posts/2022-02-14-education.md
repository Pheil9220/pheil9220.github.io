<h2> High School </h2>
I graduated from Prospect High School in Mt. Prospect, IL in the spring of 2019. While there I was introduced to Computer Science and coding, specifically in Swift (iphone apps coding language) and Java.

<h2> College </h2>
I am currently attending Miami University of Oxford Ohio. I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science, and planning to graduate in June of 2023. During my time here I've worked on research in the topic of IoT Botnet security. We researched the strenghts and vulnerabilites of variants of the Mirai Botnet.
