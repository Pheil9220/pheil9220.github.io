Ingredients:
- Maruchan Noodles 
- Boullion Cube or jar of Better than Bouillon
- Egg
- (Optional) Scallions or Green Onion



Instructions:

1. Bring pot of water to a boil; add appropriate amount of Bouillon item (or the powder packet if you only have that. After this go buy some bouillon poduct so you dont have to do that again.) 

2. Add noodles and boil for about 4 minutes (or a little longer or shorter, the noodles will be in there for about 3 more minutes w the egg)


3. Add the egg (carefully; make sure not to break it). Cook for 3 minutes with the noodles. *If it foams up turn down the heat rather than stirring so you don't break it. 


4. Once it's done the egg should be solid but not all the way through; it's hard to poach an egg like this and get it right. Worst case scenario you got a hard boiled egg in your ramen; you'll do better next time you make it

	

5. optional step: if you have chopped green onions/scallions you can add them onto your bowl of ramen as a garnish


And that is it! Enjoy your ramen and be sure to comment with recipes you want to see in the future!
