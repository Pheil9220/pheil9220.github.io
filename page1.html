<h3> Site Map</h3>
<p>
This site is organized into 3 pages. <br><br>
The page you are on currently is the home page, or landing page. It displays information about the site and it's features. It can be accessed by selecting Home on the navigation bar at the top of the screen.<br><br>
The second page is the Weather Page. It displays a weather forecast for your location using the TomTom API and the OpenWeatherMap API. This page can be accessed by selecting Weather on the navigation bar.<br><br>
The third page is the Log page. It retrieves records (logs) of all previous Weather page API calls, and their results. It is organized by day. If there are multiple forecast calls for a day the user may select the one they wish to view. This page can be accessed by selecting Log on the navigation bar. <br>
