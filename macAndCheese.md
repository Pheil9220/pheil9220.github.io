title: Stovetop Mac and Cheese from scratch
subtitle: Takes about 30 minutes, serves 2 to 3
---

Ingredients:
- 1 block (pound) of mild cheddar
- 1/2 pound of gruyere  (Try to avoid aged gruyere, or our sauce will get all oily) *More on this below*
- 1/2 can of evaporated milk (Not sweetened milk; they look similar but are not the same)
- 1 bag of macaroni noodles; I'm not sure if it's really necessary but i like to get the good kind for this recipe

*Note* Aged cheeses have much less moisture than normal cheese; as a result using aged cheeses makes our sauce more oily, which isn't what we want. If you can only find aged gruyere you can still use it; just try to add it at the very end to preserve as much of it's moisture as possible.

Instructions:
1. Shred your blocks of cheese into separate bowls. 

2. Pour your noodles into a medium to large frying pan. Spread them out evenly so there is a thin layer of noodles along the bottom of the pan.

3. Fill the pan with water so it just covers the layer of noodles.

4. Boil the water and stir your noodles. You will need to stir  constantly for about 8 minutes. Keep your eye on the pan because there is very little extra water and it can burn faster than normal pasta.

5. Once the water is almost entirely gone (it's going to look almost all bubbles at this point) you can turn down the heat and add your evaporated milk. Use about 1/2 a can and stir it into the noodles. 

6. Now add your cheese by the handful while stirring, so none burns and it melts in consistently. As you near the end of your cheese try sampling some (if it's too sharp add more cheddar, if too bland add more gruyere etc).

 

And that's it, thank you for reading! If you want to spice up this recipe you can try adding ingredients that would mix well (bacon, sausage, jalapenos etc).
